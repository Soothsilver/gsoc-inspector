minor things cahnged already.

Things that should be taken care of:
-----------------------------------------
- Everything will now compile except for the gov.nasa.jpf.inspector.server package.

getLastInstruction()
getLastChoiceGenerator()
getLastThreadInfo()
getThreadNumber()
 -- no longer exist; there appears to be no substitute except by structural refactoring

Listener.(any method) now requires ThreadInfo as an an arugment
  --

There was a split of "Instruction" among the class "Instruction" and the interface "JVMInstruction". The interface is used only for visitors. This causes the instructions under pathanalysis to be unable to run.
  -- This is used in pathanalysis package only.

ClassInfo.getResolvedClassInfo()
ClassInfo.getLoadedClasses()
  --  has probably just moved to ClassLoaderInfo, although this remains to be tested.

StaticArea class
  -- there appears to be no substitute
