### This is the project configuration file for the jpf-inspector extension.

jpf-inspector = ${config_path}

# Import jpf-shell. This is always necessary, even for command line execution.
@using jpf-shell

### Search class
# Because of how jpf-core loads property files, if this folder or a subfolder is in the initial classpath,
# then this property will be overwritten by jpf-core's default search class. This is why, when running classes
# from the IDE, one must specify search.class explicitly in the application properties.
search.class=gov.nasa.jpf.inspector.server.jpf.DFSearchInspector

### Extensibility

jpf-inspector.custom_hit_conditions = extensibility.OnLineHitCondition
# A list of classes, comma-separated, that should be loaded as custom hit conditions. They must implement the CustomHitCondition interface.
# These classes must be in the collected native classpath.

jpf-inspector.custom_commands = extensibility.CustomCmdTotalHitcount
# A list of classes, comma-separated, that should be loaded as custom commands. They must implement the CustomCommand interface.
# These classes must be in the collected native classpath.

# The following are aliases for existing commands or their variants:

# GDB-style aliases:
jpf-inspector.alias.c = continue
jpf-inspector.alias.s = step_instruction

# For testing purposes only (remove later on):
jpf-inspector.alias.hi = hello
jpf-inspector.alias.invalid = dfgsdfg dfgsdfgh dfhsh


# "commence" brings the program into the position at which it can stop and stops there
jpf-inspector.alias.commence = create breakpoint instruction_type=any && run && wait
jpf-inspector.alias.brk = create breakpoint position=*:{0}

### Inspector configuration

log.level = WARNING
# log.level = WARNING
# Default log.level is WARNING. The JPF Inspector does not support advanced logging configuration, such as remote console.

jpf-inspector.theme = white_on_black
#jpf-inspector.theme = black_on_white
# If no theme is set, black_on_white is assumed.

jpf-inspector.ignore_breakpoints_in_ignored_classes = true
jpf-inspector.ignored_classes=java.*,javax.*,sun.*
# If true, then breakpoints won't trigger when the topmost stack frame is a method under the "java" or "javax" namespace.
# It is possible to change the list of ignored classes/namespaces. You may use the '*' (asterisk) wildcard.

jpf-inspector.safe_mode = true
# If true, the user is prevented from using commands that might crash the Inspector. For example, it will only permit
# the "break" command when JPF is running.

jpf-inspector.batch_mode = false
# If batch mode is activated, the "echo-input" and "block-unsafe" subproperties take effect.
# By default, batch mode removes prompts from being displayed.
# Batch mode only works in command line mode - it is not possible to use batch mode using the Swing shell.

jpf-inspector.batch_mode.echo_input = true
# If batch mode is active and echo-input is true, then all input commands will be displayed on screen along with prompts.

jpf-inspector.batch_mode.block_unsafe = false
# TODO this is not working correctly now.
# If batch mode is active, safe mode is active and block_unsafe is true,
# then all commands that only work when JPF is suspended will block execution until JPF stops again.

jpf-inspector.request_focus_on_verify = true
# If true, then, after the "run" command is executed, the Inspector console should remain visible



jpf-inspector.prevent_beeps = true
# If true, then the Inspector will override the look-and-feel of the GUI in order to prevent beeps
# from occurring when executing commands or typing Backspace.
